# Workflow Ignitor

This repo contains small app that will help me with project creation. Often times I'm creating tiny app / script to handle particular task, it would be cool to create whole project backend (local repo, online repo, IDE project) with just a single CLI command.

## Requirements

* Python3
* [PyGithub](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub)
